[Example project PieChart](https://github.com/pavanpodila/PieChart) from [Pavan Podila - Blog post on creating an animated Pie Chart](http://blog.pixelingene.com/2012/02/animating-pie-slices-using-a-custom-calayer/) ported to Swift

__Some of the concepts in this code include:__

- Use of Custom `CALayer`, the `PieSliceLayer`
- Animatable custom properties on a `CALayer`
- A `UIView` that hosts the `PieSliceLayer`
